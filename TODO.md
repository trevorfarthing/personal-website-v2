# TODO

- Due to issues with autoplay on Safari, on first load of songs page, will need to press play button twice on first track selected.

- Setup Github Actions to new S3 bucket and move where my domain name is pointing to
- Remove some old song cards and add new ones

# Ideas

- Try dynamic import for iFrames to optimize - wrap in separate component
- Collapse button on work sections
- Specify sizes prop on all images to optimize
- Click on images in work section to bring up a larger picture viewer
- Fix any remaining console warnings/errors
